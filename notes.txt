^_9 introduces a new ruler with tab positions and text density information.
In particular, it marks how wide the document is. The very first ruler in
the document also sets the parameters for the header/footer of each page (if
present).

^_R introduces a special ruler that applies to all footnotes.

Leading spaces in the ruler set the left margin. The actual text width is
marked between [ and ]. A period or colon signals a normal position, and a
^G (7) or # marks a tab stop. The latter are decimal tabs for aligning decimal
points.

Tabs are expanded upon entry and don't change when the ruler is manipulated
later unless the user explicitly requests a reformat. If normal positions are
flagged with a colon, then pressing TAB will insert periods instead of
(variable) spaces.

After the closing ], there are flags. The first flag signals the character
pitch; it can be set when creating a new ruler:

0: pica, 65 characters, 6.5"
1: elite, 78 characters, 6.5"
2: condensed, 112 characters, 6.5"
3: expanded, 39 characters, 6.5"

The next flag is 1, if the right margin is justified or 0 if it is ragged.

The third flag sets the line spacing. 1 for normal spacing and 2 for double-
spaced text; all the way up to 9. When entering the text, blank lines are
inserted as necessary.

The fourth and final flag determines whether proportional spacing should be
used.

The default ruler is 65 characters wide, starting at the first printable
position. Tab stops are each 5 positions, and character pitch is pica.

An actual space character ' ' is a non-breaking space. This is in contrast
to variable-width space characters ^^ (30) that are followed by
padding ^\ (28). A trailing ^^ (30) denotes a soft line break inside
of a paragraph. Furthermore, there are indent ^] (29) characters that
correspond to tab stops.

^_1 introduces a header format, ^_2 introduces a footer format. Both
commands take parameters for "left", "center", "right" and "flags".
Flags are "1" if header and footer shows up on the first page, and "0"
otherwise. Each of these fields are separated from each other by
a single ^_.  A # marks the current page number in any of the fields.

^_0 sets global flags:
  06601030305800
  066030003040000132006000006008000
^_0PPTTHHFFBB???L
P page length in lines
T TOF number of lines
H head margin
F foot margin
B BOF number of lines
L set to 1 for 1.5 line spacing

TOF and BOF are top/bottom of form. They allow for setting the blank
margin at the top or bottom of the page. The head and foot margin give
the amount of space between header/footer and body of the text
*including* the header/footer itself. Setting this value to zero skips
the header/footer entirely.

^_F sets a couple of different global flags:
^_F?AB???S??N
A lines above footnote
B lines below footnote
S seperation line length
N start numbering footnotes from

Each page has a block with the footnotes that appear on this page.
It is stored in increasing numeric order of footnotes without any
gaps in the numbering. At the end of this block, there is a single
line with ^_E

Pages end either when the total number of lines has been reached or
when encountering a ^L character marking a hard page break. Furthermore,
conditional page breaks can protect lines from being broken up. This
is marked by ^K (11) followed by the number of protected lines as an ASCII
value offset by 0x10. ^K\x11 protects a single line. This is used
for footnotes, so that they don't get split across pages.

Each footnote starts with
^_NFFF:CCCCRRRRLLLL
F numeric identifier of the footnote
C zero-indexed column number where footnote originated
R zero-indexed line number where footnote originated
L number of lines in the footnote

This header is immediately followed by as many lines as indicated,
making up an embedded document.

In all cases, footnotes are numbered starting at one, even if the
visual representation uses a different starting offset.

Any line that has footnotes starts with a conditional one-line page
break ^K^Q (11, 17). The actual location of the footnote is printed
with the superscript attribute and is enclosed between two ^X (24). It
has two comma separated fields. The two digit number of lines in the
footnote, the comma, and the numeric footnote index.

^_8 is used to embed graphics.

Text styles/attributes are set by escape sequences.
\x1B\x80 normal
\x1B\x81 bold
\x1B\x82 light
\x1B\x84 italic
\x1B\x88 underline
\x1B\x90 superscript
\x1B\xA0 subscript
These bit values can be combined, but the combination of bold and
light is invalid, as is super- combined with subscript.
